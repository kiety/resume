                    <p>Starting and owning a company of my own was an opportunity that brought great learning experiences. Being forced to learn the business side of owning and operating a business became a crash course in legal setup. This experience was extremely rewarding, however. It showed, above all, that time management, flexibility, and dedication are the keys to success.</p>

                    <p>I was challenged at S&S to push my engineering abilities. Our engineering team was small, and due to the rapidly evolving world of Lithium battery technology, we had to learn new skills from each other quickly. This allowed me to expand the software knowledge I had picked up through my adulthood and gave me the opportunity to first work on software in a professional setting.</p>
                    <p>My involvement with these projects allowed us to utilize my expertise in structures, kinematics, and manufacturing to provide valuable insight to the team and adapt designs to better suite project goals. It was gratifying to be relied upon by my team in this way and to act as a mentor to my colleagues to share my expertise.</p>

                    <p>As a contracting company, our primary goal was satisfying customer needs. Through excellent communication and dedication to designing a great product, I recieved many accolades from our customers. With offices and customers across the globe, communcation skills were critical to a successful project.</p>
                    <p>In this role I managed multiple teams of engineers simultaneously. Each project had vastly different milestone timelines, but I was able to lead each team to success for our customers. </p>

                    <p>My first job out of college excersized my skills working with multiple teams of different disciplines to acheive a common goal. Though many stakeholders had different views on how the project should perform, it often fell on the engineering team to present the compromises nessessary to please all stakeholders.</p>
                    <p>Becoming familiar with creating test plans and proceedures was a neccessary part of engineering, as all projects were tested in-house. This was a great learning experience in test methods and data aquisition.</p>
